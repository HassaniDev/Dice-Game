# Dice Game 🎲

A simple two-player dice game built with vanilla JavaScript. Players take turns rolling a dice to accumulate points, but rolling a 1 resets their current score. The first player to reach **100 points** wins.

This project demonstrates core JavaScript concepts like **DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, and **game logic**.

## 📝 Features

- 🎲 **Two-player game**: Players take turns to roll a dice and accumulate points.
- ❌ **Rolling a 1 resets the current score**: Rolling a 1 will reset the player’s round score, and the turn is passed to the next player.
- 🏆 **Winning condition**: The first player to reach **100 points** wins the game.
- 🖱️ **Interactive buttons**: Includes buttons for rolling the dice, holding the score, and resetting the game.
- 💻 **Vanilla JavaScript**: Built with modern JavaScript using DOM manipulation and event handling.

## 🚀 How to Play

1. **Roll the dice**: Click on the "Roll Dice" button to roll the dice. The result is added to your current score unless you roll a 1.
2. **Hold your score**: Click "Hold" to save your current score to your total score. It’s then the next player's turn.
3. **Watch out for the 1!**: If you roll a 1, your current score is reset, and your turn ends.
4. **Win the game**: Be the first player to reach 100 points to win!

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)**

## 🏗️ MVC Architecture

This project is structured using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, which helps in organizing the code and separating concerns.

- **Model**: Represents the data and the business logic of the application.
- **View**: Handles the presentation layer, displaying the user interface.
- **Controller**: Manages user input and interacts with both the Model and View to update the UI accordingly.
